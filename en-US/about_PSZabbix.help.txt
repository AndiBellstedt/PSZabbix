SHORT DESCRIPTION
    This modules enables an administrator to do and automate common
    administration operations on a Zabbix server.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    This module aims at making it easy to automate the creation of standard 
    objects inside Zabbix. That way, Zabbix can be included inside fully 
    automated workflows like server provisioning. It may for example be used 
    inside a script task of SCVMM to reference a new VM inside Zabbix after 
    creation, or to add a newly created user (by your preferred provisioning 
    tool) to a set of user groups.

    The objects which can be managed are only the basic objects: hosts, host 
    groups, users, user groups, templates and a few others. The module does not
    expose the full Zabbix API. We actually expect administrators to use the
    Zabbix UI to do complex operations like adding monitored items to hosts or
    templates (moreover, these operations being rare, there is little value in
    automating them). 

    This module is tested on Zabbix 2.4 and later, 3.2 and later. It should 
    also work and other versions but without any guarantee.

EXAMPLES
    Import-Module PSZabbix # only needed if powershell version <=3
    New-ZbxApiSession "http://myserver/zabbix/api_jsonrpc.php" (Get-Credentials MyAdminLogin)
    Get-ZbxHost
